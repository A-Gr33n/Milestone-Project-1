     <p> Testing each attribute there were errors that needed to be solved.
     
     #### Perfomance

    <p>solution: Images are reduced by size in Style.CSS to met the perfomance standard and to be compatiable on mobile screens. 
    
   * render- blocking needed to be eliminated, 
     <p> solution: Script element was in the body element which needed to be 
     in head element.
   
   
    
   #### Asccessibilty   
     
  * links did not have a discernible name. (Did not link text for social links)

  * the heading elements were not in a sequentially-descending order.
      <p> solution: Changed heading size in footer to follow logical order.
